				<strong>The CADG dataset</strong> <b>is a new dataset for <i><u>C</u>rowd <u>A</u>nomaly detection from <u>D</u>rone and <u>G</u>round views</b></i>.
				<br><br>
				The dataset provides a sophisticated simulation of how people would behave during an incident or accident in a public space, 
				allowing the evaluation of various crowd activity detection methods for application in real-world situations.
				The dataset is not only the largest and most comprehensive dataset currently available for crowd anomaly detection, 
				but also provides videos captured by both a moving drone and fixed cameras.
				<br><br>
				From the analysis of crime statistics in public spaces and the perspective of importance in crowd monitoring, 
				we have selected four important crowd anomaly activities, 
				i.e., (i) <i>fight</i>, (ii) <i>theft</i>, (iii) <i>illness</i>, and (iv) <i>dispersion</i>, as shown in the following examples.
				All videos were recorded in a gymnasium with up to 12 actors.
				<br><br>
				The normal activities include a wide variety of daily activities such as random walking, standing, texting while walking, and talking with several people.
				For the anomaly activities, a few randomly selected people played particularly important roles, such as people suddenly falling ill or robbers.
				The rest of the actors intervened by, for example, walking around while paying attention, stopping to observe the incident, or talking to the afflicted or victims.
